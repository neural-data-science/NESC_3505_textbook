<div class="section" id="background-and-rationale">
<h1>Background and Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#background-and-rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Most areas of neuroscience research and development rely on increasingly large and complex data sets. Discovery and application in neuroscience thus relies on the ability to manage these large data sets, and extract meaning from them. In other words, neuroscience now relies heavily on <strong>data science</strong>, which has been variously defined as “…an umbrella term to describe the entire complex and multistep processes used to extract value from data.” (Wing, 2019) and the ability to “bring structure to large quantities of formless data and make analysis possible” (Davenport &amp; Patil, 2012, p.73).</p>
<p><strong>In neuroscience, data science is an increasingly necessary skill.</strong> Data from techniques like single-cell recordings, local field potentials, EEG, and fMRI is complex and multidimensional. Being able to understand, manipulate, and visualize the structure of these complex datasets is a necessary skill for performing the resaerch. On top of this, it is increasingly clear that very large data sets - often built collaboratively by many labs - are required to make reliable inferences about neuroscientific processes. Making inferences also depends on computational models - ways of identifying and representing patterns in the data. While some of these will be familiar from statistics class, a wide range of statistical and machine learning models are now widely used in neuroscience.</p>
<p>While data science and statistics are overlapping fields, statistics is generally focused on the specific task of testing hypotheses based on data. Data science more broadly includes the storage, manipulation, visualization, filtering, and preparation of data that is typically required prior to statistical analysis. Data Science does also encompass statistics, as well as machine learning; whereas statistics generally involves deriving conclusions from existing data, machine learning involves making predictions from a data set that will generalize to other data. Since statistics is covered in other courses in the neuroscience and psychology curricula, this course focuses instead on the other “front end” aspects of data science described above. Other areas of data science, including “back-end” data science (engineering, hardware, databases) and software development, will not be covered.</p>
<p>Central to data science is the ability to use scientific programming languages, such as Python, Matlab, and R. This ability includes a strong understanding of the fundamentals of at least one programming language, and the ability to extend one’s knowledge through continuous learning and problem-solving. This course teaches Python, a mature and widely-used language in neuroscience and data science more broadly. However, much of the fundamentals of scientific programming and data science are common to all many languages. Thus, having learned Python, you will be better-prepared to learn new languages in the future, as necessary.</p>
<p>Another important facet of data science is that it is a <strong>team endeavour</strong>. On the one hand, it is founded on open, shared software developed by widely distributed teams of contributors. On the other hand, the practice of data science typically involves teams of individuals with complementary skillsets, both due to the size and complexity of many projects. In science, these teams often comprise students and faculty members in collaborating labs distributed around the world. This class prepares you for such collaboration by developing and coaching your teamwork skills, as well as teaching you how to use software platforms that support such collaboration.</p>
<p>The skills learned in this class will benefit students working in a wide variety of areas of neuroscience. As well, the class will provide an introductory foundation in data science that can be applied to a wide range of areas of research and application, in academia, industry, and government.</p>

<h1>Class Format and Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#class-format-and-schedule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This class consists of the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Online lectures, lessons and tutorials</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled class time to work on assignments and get guidance from the teaching team</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="online-lectures-and-tutorials">
<h2>Online lectures and tutorials<a class="headerlink" href="#online-lectures-and-tutorials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course employs a “flipped classroom” model, and is designed to be offered in an online format. Lectures and tutorials are pre-recorded and available online for viewing at any time. Many of these lessons involve quizzes and coding activities. You are expected to complete assigned lessons prior to scheduled class times. <strong>This course requires that you put in significant hours per week outside of class: at the outset, you should budget 16 h/week for a 7-week condense summer version of the course, or 8 h/week for the regular term version.</strong> This is in addition to 2-3 h/week of class time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scheduled-class-time">
<h2>Scheduled Class Time<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduled-class-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scheduled class times are devoted to working on assignments and projects, with the teaching team available for discussion and guidance. Students will be encouraged to present short tutorials explaining how they approached and solved different problems. In online delivery, these are held as group video sessions, with screen sharing. Classes involve assignments that build on the online lessons, so students who have not completed the online lessons prior to class time will not get much benefit from the class time. Participation in the scheduled classes is not mandatory, but strongly recommended. <strong>Scheduled class times are the only times when the teaching team is available for live consultation on course work</strong>. Questions submitted outside of class time may be addressed by the teaching team during class time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-materials">
<h1>Course Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#course-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All necessary materials will be provided online, either on or through Brightspace. <strong>You must have access to a computer</strong> running a recent version of the Mac, Windows, Chrome, or Linux operating systems. It is not possible to complete the course using only a mobile device (phone, tablet/iPad). <strong>You must also have access to internet service</strong> of sufficient quality to stream videos and maintain a live connection to remote servers.</p>
<p>Beyond these basic requirements, this course emphasizes (and will teach you about) openly accessible resources including the software that runs the course, open access to the course materials, and the use of external resources that are available for free. No textbook is required. This course will rely on <em>Open Educational Resources</em>—materials that are freely accessible and openly licensed—including online tutorials, videos, and books. A wide variety of educational materials (free and paid) for data science are available, and this course teaches an approach to lifelong learning and exploration by which you will be able to find critically evaluate the information necessary to perform desired tasks.</p>

<h1>Assessment/Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#assessment-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="online-lessons-10">
<h2>Online Lessons (10%)<a class="headerlink" href="#online-lessons-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Online lessons are to be completed prior to class time. Deadlines are provided online. The value of each lesson is 10/the number of assigned lessons. Each lesson is graded on a pass/fail basis, based on whether you complete the lesson or not. Lessons can be completed later than the posted due date, up to the last day of class, with no penalty. However, not completing lessons by the posted due dates will leave you unprepared for future classes and assignments. No points for lessons will be granted after the last day of class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-assignments-10">
<h2>Class Assignments (10%)<a class="headerlink" href="#class-assignments-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are coding assignments that you will complete, based on neuroscience data. There is an assignment due every week, except weeks when projects are due. Scheduled class time is the only time you will be able to get help on the assignments from the teaching team. There will be 6 assignments over the term, each graded pass/fail. Your best 4 assignment grades will count towards your final mark. The value of each of those 4 assignments is 2.5% of your final grade, up to a total of 10%. Assignment due dates and times are posted online. Because your final mark is based on only your 4 best assignments, and graded pass/fail, no late assignments will be accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projects-50">
<h2>Projects (50%)<a class="headerlink" href="#projects-50" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 data science projects to complete. Project 1 is worth 20%  of your final grade, and Project 2 is worth 30%. These projects are directly based on the class assignments, but integrate across multiple classes and assignments, as well as requiring you to extend and apply what you have learned, to new contexts. Unlike assignments, projects are work that each student is expected to do independently, and figure out solutions for on your own. The teaching team will only offer general guidance and help in completing projects.
Late work will be penalized 1% per hour, with the clock starting the minute after the deadline has elapsed. Requests for extensions must be made prior to the due date.</p>

<h2>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Attendance scheduled class meetings is optional. However, due to the flipped classroom model, scheduled class times are the only time when you can ask the instructor for help or guidance with coursework. You may also find some of the discussions held during class time useful to support your learning. Outside of scheduled class time, the instructor is not available to help with course work. However, if you have other issues you need to discuss (e.g., personal reasons that make it difficult for you to succeed in the class), you may contact the instructor by email to discuss the matter either that way, or in a meeting (online or in-person).</p>

<h2>Academic Freedom<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-freedom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Freedom of speech and of thought are cornerstones of academic institutions such as Dalhousie. Our goal in science is to observe and characterize the world accurately and objectively. However, we must realize that our perceptions of reality are often coloured by our beliefs and assumptions, some of which we may not be aware of. Academic freedom includes not only the freedom to think as you please, but others’ freedom do express their beliefs as well. Please do not hesitate to express your ideas, but do so in a way that is respectful of others. This is the only avenue for the free expression and exchange of ideas.</p>

<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all of our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect (The Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University, 1999). As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all of the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity.

<h2>Accessibility<a class="headerlink" href="#accessibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Advising and Access Services Centre is Dalhousie’s centre of expertise for student accessibility and accommodation. The advising team works with students who request accommodation as a result of a disability, religious obligation, or any barrier related to any other characteristic protected under Human Rights legislation (Canada and Nova Scotia).

<h2>Student Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#student-code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if students don’t follow this community expectation. When appropriate, violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal manner—perhaps through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution can’t be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute resolution.

We are a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness.
