- Extract meaning from data, but also articulate the limitations of the conclusions you can draw from it
- Write functional and efficient code in Python to perform basic data science tasks
- Use AI coding assistants to generate Python code to perform basic data science tasks
- Critically evaluate, test, and debug code generated by AI coding assistants
- Use online tools for version control, collaborative software development, and project management
- Read and write data files in common formats such as CSV and Excel
- Organize and manipulate data structures such as lists, arrays, and data frames
- Work with continuous, discrete, and factorial data, and understand distinctions between them
- Visualize data in a variety of graphical formats
