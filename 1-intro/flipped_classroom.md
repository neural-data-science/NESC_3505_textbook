# Flipped Classroom

This course uses a **flipped classroom** approach. This means that class time is not used for conveying information, the way a normal lecture-based class operates. This textbook and associated [video lessons are all online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfEWMIgWS22MMZjPIzBRE2cHhMcvEKwp), for you to watch on your own time, ideally on the [schedule](https://neural-data-science.github.io/NESC_3505/schedule) set out with the syllabus. In the lectures you are expected to code along with what is being demonstrated. Then, class time is used as an opportunity for students to discuss the course material, practice their skills, and ask questions from the teaching team. As a practical lab course, this course requires you spend a lot of time at a computer, writing and debugging code to solve data science problems (rather than studying and memorizing). Think of the computer as your lab bench, with the added bonus that you can take it with you anywhere!
