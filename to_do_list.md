# Ways to improve this book/course



## Videos
Students don't just want the textbook, they want video walkthroughs of the textbook

## Tricky Topics
Apparently Jen & Leanne have created a phenomenon. This was asked for by students this year


## Visualization

- Matplotlib - don't start with 2 ways of doing things (procedural and OO). Introduce OO and then have a "bonus" section explaining the differences, once OO is deeply ingrained.
- **subplots** - explain in more detail, and move description of this from being buried in *intro_spike_trains*.
    - update all other chapters/sections to use OO approach to Matplotlib

- in **Single Unit -> Working with pandas**
    - break into subsections
    - show how to do heat maps

## Research designs
- Separately, a chapter on research designs, such as factorials, and differences between discrete and continuous data.


- How to critically evaluate EDA. They're not doing this and we're not teaching them how. It's more than just drawing the plots, they need to think about what they're plotting, how to structure the plots to reflect the experimental design and answer the questions being asked.
    - also need to talk about magnitude of difference, statistical thinking a la Geoff Cummings. Including what error bars are and how to draw them correctly, and how to eyeball effect sizes.
- a clear style guide (chapter) that talks about how to report data - how to write a Results section
