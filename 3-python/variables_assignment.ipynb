Python PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) (PEPs are the \"Python Enhancement Proposals\" that provide standards for the language) specifies that regular variables \"should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability\". \n",
    "    \n",
    "So, **you should only use lower-case letters**in variable names. This is because upper-case letters are used for specific purposes in Python. As well, if your variable name is more than one word (such as `first_name`), you should use underscores to separate the words. This naming convention is called **snake case**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You may encounter different conventions as standard in other programming languages (or in examples of Python that don't properly follow style conventions), such as [**camel case**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) which would be `FirstName` or possibly `firstName` (for the aficionados: the first is is a sub-type of camel case called **Pascal case**, while the second is **dromedary case**). \n",
    "    \n",
    "There is a good reason for following these conventions: when a seasoned Python programmer sees something in camel case, they will expect it to be a class or type variable, not a regular variable.
