    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "You are currently viewing a Jupyter notebook file. Jupyter notebooks are composed of *cells*. Cells can be of three types: code, Markdown, or raw. This cell you're reading is Markdown, a simple language for formatting rich text. The cell below is a code cell, where you can write and run Python commands. Raw cells are \"raw\" text — they aren't fancy-formatted Markdown, and they aren't run-able as code. They also aren't terribly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells have two modes: **Edit** and **Command**.  In Edit mode, you will see a flashing cursor, and you can type into the cell and edit it. In Command mode, manipulate it in certain ways (e.g., deleting a whole cell, or moving it). Only one cell is ever in Edit mode at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text you are currently reading is a Markdown cell. Assuming you are viewing it in VS Code, and click once on this text, the cell should become active in command mode, so you should see a some colour cue that it is now selected (the specifics depend on the color theme you are using). If you double-click on this (or any other Markdown) cell, the text will change to a *fixed-width* font and you'll see the Markdown formatting tags (like `#` for headings), and a flashing cursor will appear where you clicked. Try it! To return to command mode, press the Shift & Enter keys on your keyboard simultaneously, or hit the Escape key. You can also just click on another cell, however in that case this cell will remain in Edit mode --- i.e., with a fixed width font and the Markdown tags visible --- until you press Shift & Enter or Escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary:\n",
    "- Single-clicking a cell will select it in Command mode\n",
    "- Double-clicking a cell will put it in Edit mode\n",
    "- Pressing the Shift & Enter keys on your keyboard simultaneously will execute a cell. Execution will format a Markdown cell, or run the code in a code cell. \n",

    "Below is a code cell with some very simple Python code. You haven't started learning Python yet, but as you can see, at its simplest Python can act like a calculator. Before you run this cell, though, you need to tell VS Code what language you want the notebook to run code cells in. Recall that Jupyter notebooks can run code in many different languages, including Python, R, and Julia. To tell VS Code that you want to run Python code, click on the words `Select Kernel` in the top right corner of the notebook, and select the one that says `base` from the drop-down menu. (If you don't see this option, you may have missed steps in the chapter, [Get Set Up for This Course]() you will need ot have installed Anaconda, as well as the Python and Jupyter extensions for VS Code.) \n",

The currently-selected code cell also has a \"Run Cell\" button in the toolbar (which plooks like a \"Play\" icon, or triangle pointing right) --- clicking this will also execute the cell.\n",

Each notebook you open will start a new Python kernel (sometimes, as with this one, you'll need to select the kernel the first time you open the file). As long as the kernel is running, the things you do in Python will be stored in memory (RAM). This will make more sense as you start to use Python, but when you're running Python, you generally don't just run commands and get output. You also read data files into memory, and store the results of one command in memory for use in the next command. For example, a bit earlier in this notebook you were instructed to run a cell with the code `x = 1`, so now your kernel has a variable `x` in memory, with the value `1`. CLearing cell outputs doesn't affect what the kernel has in memory. If you want to clear the memory, you need to restart the kernel.\n",
