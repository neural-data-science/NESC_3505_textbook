    "Often we don't just want to open a file and extract a small bit of data (such as the minimum value in examples above). Rather, we might want to open a set of related data files and combine them into one big DataFrame. For example, in psychology and neuroscience most experiments involve multiple participants. For each participant, when we run the experiment we get a data file. To analyze the data across participants, we would want to read in all participants' data files and combined them into one DataFrame.\n",

That is, start with one DataFrame, and add a new data frame to the bottom of it, creating additional rows. In what we'll do here, we assume that all of the data files we're reading have the same columns. For example, in the Gapminder GDP data sets, each file has a column for `country` plus a series of columns for GDP in different years — and the same years are in the columns of all the data sets. "

It will end up being a list of DataFrames (remember, lists can contain just about any other Python data type), and once we have read in all the data, we will combine them into one DataFrame. This is a trick that's important to use in pandas. The reason has to do with how pandas combines DataFrames and stores them in memory. In simple terms, each time we concatenate DataFrames, pandas does a lot of internal checking to make sure there are no errors. Doing this checking once, when combining many DataFrames, is far more efficient (and thus faster) than doing it many times. Likewise, when a DataFrame is created, an appropriate amount of memory space is allocated for it on the computer. Each time we append additional data, we have to create a new, bigger block of memory. Allocating new blocks of memory, many times, takes more time than just doing it once."
