# Learning Objectives

This chapter relates to the material taught in the first two DataCamp lessons, [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). As the names inply, these will be your first steps in learning the Python language.

This, and subsequent chapters that are aligned with DataCamp lessons, do not replace the material in those lessons. Instead, they are intended as reference material or "cheat sheets" that you can use when working on the course assignments and projects, rather than having to go back and re-watch videos on DataCamp.

By the end of **Lesson 1**, you should be able to use Python to:
- perform basic operations
- assign values to variables
- use basic functions
- print the output of different commands
- understand and use basic data types
- work with lists
- use basic methods
- explain the difference between functions and methods
- explain what packages are
- load and use packages
- work with NumPy arrays

By the end of **Lesson 2**, you should be able to use Python to:
- generate and customize simple plots using Matplotlib
- create and manipulate dictionaries
- create and work with pandas DataFrames
- use comparison and Boolean operators
- distinguish the important functions of `=` and `==` in Python
- use conditional `if`/`else` statements
- use `while` and `for` loops
