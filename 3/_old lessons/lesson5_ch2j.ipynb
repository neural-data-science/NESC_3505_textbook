    "For NumPy, the first step is to create three NumPy arrays, each with different dimensions. To do this we use NumPy's `random.rand()` function, which creates an array with a specified shape, filled with random numbers. We *chain* this with the `.round()` method to shorten the numbers, then multiply the array by 100 to convert the numbers from values less than 1, to values in the 0-100 range (this uses NumPy *broadcasting* to apply the multiplication to each element of the array). This is done to make the numbers easy to look at, as well as demonstrating chaining and broadcasting."

    "## Combining pandas arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are relatively easy to work with, because they contain only numbers. Real datasets stored in pandas DataFrames present unique challenges, though, because they contain *labelled data*, and often they containg *missing data*. For instance, in a study an individual human participant may provide data on a number of tests, such as a working memory span, reading comprehension, and nonverbal intelligence. Sometimes, for any number of reasons (e.g., time, technical failures, human error), an individual's data on one test may be missing. As another example, in a reaction time (RT) study each participant will complete a large number of trials, resulting in *repeated measures* from the same individual (RT measures on each trial). On some trials, individuals may fail to respond, resulting in missing data for those trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data creates problems when combining data. Depending on the situation, it may be preferable to replace missing values with null values (which appear in Python as `NaN`, for 'not a number'), or it may be preferable to have complete data and leave out data that we don't have for all of the inputs (e.g., drop the data from one test completely, if we don't have data for every participant).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where teh terms **inner join** and **outer join** come in. This is a bit of jargon you need to learn, but it's pretty logical. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **outer join** involves filling in missing values with `NaN`. In formal logical terms, this is the *union* of the input data sets. This is the default for `pd.concat()`. You can also think of the names as reflecting the fact that this approach includes all the data within the 'outer' boundaries of the DataFrame, like a box drawn around the entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **inner join** involves keeping only the data that is complete for all inputs. In formal logic, this is the *intersection* of the inputs (i.e., only what they all have in common). You can think of the term 'inner' as referring to the fact that this takes only the data inside that big outer box, that has no missing data. "

The first question is whether horizontal or vertical concatenation makes more sense. Since each row of data in each data set corresponds to one individual, it really doesn't make sense to combine these horizontally. So we want to concatenate vertically, stacking the rows. For this we use the `axis=0` argument."
