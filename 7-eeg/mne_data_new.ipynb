    "## Import raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "For EEG, raw data is typically stored in a one or more files containing continuous EEG data. There are many different proprietary file formats for EEG data; most of these are developed by the manufacturer of a particular EEG system, since an integral part of an EEG system is software to save the data for later analysis. Fortunately, MNE provides functions to import data from most common EEG systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, we are working with data from a system sold by Brain Products, whose software is called *Brain Vision*. So we will use MNE's `read_raw_brainvision()` function. The Brain Vision format actually specifies *three files* for any given data set. The three files are all created at the time that the EEG data is acquired, and it's important to ensure that all three are copied when moving them around. The files are as follows:\n",
    "- `*.eeg` is the actual EEG data (electrical potential measurements for all electrodes, at all time points). This is stored in a compressed (binary) format\n",
    "- `*.vmrk` is a text file containing all of the markers (*trigger codes*) that were sent to the EEG system during data collection, by the stimulus computer. These typically encode the onset of various stimuli, and times of any responses by the participant, as well as and what each stimulus/response was. \n",
    "- `*.vhdr` is a text file with header information, or **metadata** about the data set, including technical details such as the sampling rate, and the settings of the EEG amplifier during the recording. The `.vhdr` file is particularly important because it specifies the file names of the `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files (although they should always be named consistently with the header file). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `read_raw_brainvision()` the file we will actually pass as an argument is the `.vhdr` file. Since it specifies the names of the associated `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files, from this file MNE can find the data and markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, many of MNE's functions are nested inside subfolders (modules); for example, all of the file input-output (I/O) routines are in the module `mne.io`. So when we call the `read_raw_brainvision()` function, we have to do so as `mne.io.read_raw_brainvision()`. The one required argument for this function is the file name, and that's all we need for now: "

However, by default although our raw data contains the *names* of each channel, it does not contain information regarding where each channel was located. Fortunately, in this and most EEG studies, the electrode positions were based on the International 10-20 system. This was first introduced as a way of standardizing EEG electrode placement in clinical neurology, and is so-named because electrode positions are determined by first measuring the anterior-posterior and left-right dimensions of the participant's head, and then placing electrodes at positions determined by 10 and 20% increments of those measurements (E.g., electrode Cz is placed 50% of the anterior-posterior and left-right measurements). More recently, [Oostenveld and Praamstra (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00527-7) published an extension of this called the 10-5 system, that allows for a larger number of electrodes based on 5% increments. You can read more about this system and its variants on [Oostenveld's blog](https://robertoostenveld.nl/electrode/#oostenveld2001). \n",
