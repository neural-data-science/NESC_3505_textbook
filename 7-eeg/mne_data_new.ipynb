If you don't run this when using MNE, you will find that MNE provides a lot output, and often including some concerning-looking Python warning messages. Most of these warnings are safely ignored. I generally find this output more confusing than helpful, and turn it off routinely. For our lessons we will keep the output off because it just creates confusion.\n",

    "## Import raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "For EEG, raw data is typically stored in a one or more files containing continuous EEG data. There are many different proprietary file formats for EEG data; most of these are developed by the manufacturer of a particular EEG system, since an integral part of an EEG system is software to save the data for later analysis. Fortunately, MNE provides functions to import data from most common EEG systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, we are working with data from a system sold by Brain Products, whose software is called *Brain Vision*. So we will use MNE's `read_raw_brainvision()` function. The Brain Vision format actually specifies *three files* for any given data set. The three files are all created at the time that the EEG data is acquired, and it's important to ensure that all three are copied when moving them around. The files are as follows:\n",
    "- `*.eeg` is the actual EEG data (electrical potential measurements for all electrodes, at all time points). This is stored in a compressed (binary) format\n",
    "- `*.vmrk` is a text file containing all of the markers (*trigger codes*) that were sent to the EEG system during data collection, by the stimulus computer. These typically encode the onset of various stimuli, and times of any responses by the participant, as well as and what each stimulus/response was. \n",
    "- `*.vhdr` is a text file with header information, or **metadata** about the data set, including technical details such as the sampling rate, and the settings of the EEG amplifier during the recording. The `.vhdr` file is particularly important because it specifies the file names of the `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files (although they should always be named consistently with the header file). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `read_raw_brainvision()` the file we will actually pass as an argument is the `.vhdr` file. Since it specifies the names of the associated `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files, from this file MNE can find the data and markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, many of MNE's functions are nested inside subfolders (modules); for example, all of the file input-output (I/O) routines are in the module `mne.io`. So when we call the `read_raw_brainvision()` function, we have to do so as `mne.io.read_raw_brainvision()`. The one required argument for this function is the file name, and that's all we need for now: "
