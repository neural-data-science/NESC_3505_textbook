    "# Statistical Analysis of ERP Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen how we combine and visualize the results of an ERP experiment in the previous lesson, we will now turn to the statistical analysis of ERP data. There are a number of approaches to performing statistical tests on ERPs. As noted in the previous lesson, we can infer a significant difference between conditions from the 95% CIs around the difference waveform plot. However, typically for a scientific publication we want to report detailed statistics, such as $t$ and $p$ values. As well, we might want to consider all of the channels individually, or in clusters, rather than just one or a few channels as shown in the plot above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A conventional approach to ERP statistics is to measure the amplitude of each component of interest, averaged over a time window. For instance, we could compute the mean amplitude of the N400 at each channel from 300--500 ms. Then we could use these values in a statistical test such as a $t$ test, ANOVA, or linear mixed effects model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatio-temporal nature of EEG data presents some challenges however. If we compute a mean amplitude over a time window as described above, then we have \"collapsed\" over time so we don't need to worry about that dimension. However, in the present data we have 64 channels so we need to worry about how the ERP differences vary over space. One approach would be to define a *region of interest* (ROI) and average over the channels in that ROI. This is what we did to plot the waveforms above. We could also define a number of ROIs (e.g., dividing the scalp into a 3 x 3 grid), if we wanted to test for differences across the scalp. \n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge with picking time windows and ROIs in advance, however, is how to pick these in a way that accurately captures the time and scalp distribution of the ERP effects of interest. Defining an ROI(s) runs the risk that a component's scalp distribution might only partly overlap a particular ROIs. Typically all statistical analysis choices should be made a priori (before looking at your data), so we can't just look at the data and decide which channels to include in each ROI. Selecting a subset of data points to use in statistical analysis, based on looking at the data, is poor practice because it artificially inflates the likelihood of finding a significant result. When we apply statistics (at least in conventional approaches), we are testing hypotheses. Hypotheses are predictions about the outcome of the experiment that you should make before conducting the experiment. If you look at the data and then decide which channels to include in your ROI, you are effectively making a prediction about the data after you have seen it, which is not a valid test of your hypothesis. This is a form of **HARKing** (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known), which is a form of **p-hacking** (trying different analyses until you find one that produces a significant result). HARKing and p-hacking were discussed in the [Introduction](../1-intro/novelty.md). An excellent paper on this topic is [Luck and Gaspelin (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.12639), *How to get statistically significant effects in any ERP experiment (and why you shouldn't)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in most ERP experiments the hypotheses center around components that have been characterized in previous studies, so we can often make pretty accurate predictions as to which time windows and ROIs will be most relevant. For instance, in the present case we predicted an N400, which we knew from previous studies with similar stimuli would likely be largest between 300-500 ms at channels centered around Cz and Pz. So we could perform our statistical test on this combination of time and channels. However, there is a chance that we miss a true effect, if the timing or scalp distribution is not as predicted, or if there is a difference that we did not predict. For these reasons, it's good to also consider *data-driven* statistical approaches. We will explore each of these in turn."

    "## A priori $t$ test\n",
    "A common approach to testing whether an ERP effect is significant is to perform a $t$ test between a pair of conditions, on the ERP data averaged over a time period of interest and at one or a few electrodes. Ideally, the experimenter should have an *a priori* (i.e., defined prior to running the experiment) hypothesis regarding the time window and electrodes at which the ERP component and experimental effect of interest would be largest. In the present case, we predicted an N400, which we knew from previous studies with similar stimuli would likely be largest between 400–600 ms, at midline channels Cz, CPz, and Pz. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use the `ttest_1samp()` function from SciPy's `stats` module. This tests whether a set of values are different from zero. So we use as input the *Violation-Control* differences for each participant (`diff_waves`), since if they are significantly different from zero, that will be evidence for a difference in amplitude between these two conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first compute the average over the 400–600 ms time window, for each participant, at the channels of interest, and store these in a NumPy array on which we then perform the $t$ test.

Inside the list comprehension, we loop over the items in the list `diff_waves`, where each entry is the violation–control difference wave for one of the participants. The data itself is extracted from the `Evoked` object using the `.get_data()` method, with some kwargs:\n",
    "   - we use the `picks` kwarg to specify which electrode(s) we want. Here we pass the `roi` tuple.\n",

However, this does not give us an estimate of the true spatial extent of the effect, or whether there are other channels and/or time points that show a significant difference between conditions. For instance, we could perform a $t$ test over the N400 time window at every channel, rather than averaged over only 3 channels (in which case, what is the use of collecting data from 64 channels?). Performing a statistical test at every channel and time point is called a **mass univariate analysis**. The name refers to the fact that $t$-tests are a type of statistical test called univariate, meaning that the test centers on a single outcome value (in this case, ERP amplitude). The \"mass\" part refers to the fact that we are performing a large number of univariate tests, because we are testing the difference between conditions at every channel and time point. Thus rather than performing a single $t$-test averaged over an ROI as we did above, in the present data set if we tested at every channel and time point we would be performing 64 (channels) * 615 (time points) = 39,360 $t$-tests.\n"

    "### The Problem of Multiple Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing so many independent $t$-tests (\"independent\" meaning that the outcome of one test does depend on outcome of any other test) increases our chances of finding a significant result by chance. Statistical significance is typically determined based on a $p$ value, which is the probability of finding a result as or more extreme than the one we found, if the null hypothesis were true (i.e., if there was no real difference between conditions). In other words, if we find a $p$ value of .05, this means the probability of finding this result by chance is 1 / 100, or 5%. Thus if we perform 39,360 independent $t$-tests, and we use a threshold for significance (alpha, or $\\alpha$) of $p$ < .05, then we can expect to find 1,968 significant results by chance (39,360 * .05 = 1,968). In other words, we are likely to find nearly 2,000 time point/channel combinations that show a \"significant\" difference between conditions, even if there is no real difference between conditions. This is called the **problem of multiple comparisons**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to address the problem of multiple comparisons. One is to simply use a more stringent threshold for significance. For instance, we could use $p$ < .01, which would mean we would expect to find only 394 significant results by chance (39,360 * .01 = 394). However, this is a bit arbitrary, and it doesn't address the fact that we are performing a large number of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to correct for multiple comparisons is the **Bonferroni** method, which involves simply dividing the desired $\\alpha$ value for the experiment (i.e., across all tests) by the number of tests. For this data set that would mean $.05 / 64 * 615 = .000001$. This is a very stringent threshold, and would likely result in no significant results. However, the Bonferroni method is actually inappropriate for ERP data. It assumes that each statistical test is statistically independent of the others, which is not true for multiple channels of EEG data — nearby channels can be predicted to have similar values, since they are measuring activity from nearby scalp locations. There are, however, other multiple comparisons correction methods that are appropriate for EEG data, such as the **cluster-based permutation test**.\n"

    "## Permutation $t$ Test for Multiple Comparison Correction\n",
    "\n",
    " One popular multiple comparison correciton method for EEG data is a **permutation** $t$ test. Widely introduced to the field of neuroimaging by [Nichols and Holmes (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.1058), permutation is a well-established approach in the field of statistics. The basic concepts in permutation testing are *exchangability* and *randomization*. If we have multiple data points from two sets of experimental conditions (e.g., *Violation* and *Control*), and there is no true difference between the conditions, then it should not matter if we perform a $t$ test between the data points using the correct condition labels, or if we randomly re-label the condition of each data point (i.e., *exchange* the labels among data points). In other words, if ERP amplitude in the *Violation* and *Control* conditions are not truly different, then if we scramble which data points we call *Violation* and which ones we call *Control*, and perform the $t$ test again, the results of that $t$ test should not be too different from the $t$ test based on the correct labels. \n",
    " \n",
    " On the other hand, if there is a true experimental effect, then randomizing the labels of each data point should result in consistently lower $t$ values than the true labeling. The reason this approach is called *permutation* testing is that we perform the random exchange of labels and data points many times, each with a different reassignment (i.e., a different permutation of labels and data points). Typically this is done thousands of times, in order to get a reliable estimate of the *null distribution* — that is, the distribution of $t$ scores across different permutations that we know don't match the true label-to-data-point mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach doesn't in and of itself correct for multiple comparisons. However, when permutation tests are performed over a number of different sets of data (such as a separate $t$ test on the data from each individual electrode), can can use this to correct for multiple comparisons. This is called the **maximal statistic** method. It is based on the recognition that the distribution of $t$ (and associated $p$) values across thousands of random permutations of labels actually reflects the \"chance\" that our use $p$ values are based on. In other words, in conventional $t$ tests if we use an $\\alpha$ of .05, then we are saying that we accept a 5% chance that over many replications of the experiment we would get a \"significant\" result by chance. Since our permutation distribution actually *is* thousands of replications of an \"experiment\" in which there is no true effect, we can say that the top 5% of the $t$ values we obtain from the permutations are what we consider \"significant\". We can provide even better control for multiple comparisons by looking at the maximum $t$ values not just at each electrode separately, but across all the electrodes. We can set the critical $t$ value (i.e., the $t$ threshold for significance) to be $(\\alpha * N) + 1$, where $N$ is the number of electrodes. That is, our $t$ threshold is set so that just under 5% of the randomly-obtained $t$ values are greater than this threshold. "

    "### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional multiple comparison correction that can be applied is **clustering**. This is based on the recognition that the ERP is a spatio-temporal signal, and that any real ERP effect of interest is likely to be present not at a single channel and time point, but at a cluster of nearby channels and time points. For instance, the N400 is typically largest at midline channels Cz, CPz, and Pz, but it is also present at nearby channels such as FCz and C1. Likewise, it is typically largest between 400–600 ms, but it is also present at nearby time points such as 350 and 650 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering approach involves first performing a $t$ test at every channel and time point, over many permutations, as described above. But then we threshold the resulting set of $t$ values (in this case the $t$ value that corresponds to $p < .05$) and find clusters — cases where adjacent channels and/or time points also have above-threshold $t$ values (and with the same sign, meaning that we don't cluster positive potential differences with negative potential differences). Then, just as we built the null distribution of $t$ values across permutations, we can build a null distribution of the size of the largest cluster in each permutation. We can use that to determine the $p$ value for each cluster in the $t$ test with the correct labels, based on the proportion of permutations that have a cluster of that size or larger."

By default (which we won't change), the function uses an $\\alpha$ of .05, and uses the maximal statistic method to correct for multiple comparisons.\n",

    "## Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation cluster $t$ test is a powerful approach to correcting for multiple comparisons, while allowing the data to \"speak for itself\" rather than being constrained by a priori hypotheses. This can be useful for exploratory analyses, or for cases where the researcher has a priori hypotheses but wishes to characterize the spatial and temporal extent of an effect in the data rather than simply testing a hypothesis at a subset of time points and channels. However, the clustering approach we used above has limitations. For one, it is based on arbitrary thresholds. In order to form the clusters above, we set a $p < .05$ threshold to determine which channels and time points were \"significant\", and then formed clusters from these. This threshold is conventional, but arbitrary, and the results will depend on the data itself. The more statistical power we have (which comes from the number of trials and participants), the more likely we are to find significant results at each channel/time point. So we cannot necessarily treat the results as indicating the true boundaries of which time points and channels show a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach to determining statistical significance in cluster-based permutation testing is **threshold-free cluster enhancement** (TFCE; [Smith & Nichols, 2009](https://dx/doi.org/doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.061)). As the name implies, this method does not rely on an arbitrary threshold to determine which channels and time points are significant. Instead, it takes the statistical image (the set of $t$ values across all channels and time points) and applies a mathematical transformation, which is designed to enhance clusters of nearby channels and time points. The transformation is based on the assumption that significant ERP activity will be distributed over multiple channels and time points. Therefore it computes a \"score\" at each channel/time point which reflects the weighted sum of values from nearby channels and time points. This serves to \"enhance\" (increase) the statistical values at channels and time points when there is \"support\" for this from similar, surrounding values. In contrast, a channel/time point that has a high value but does not have support from surrounding channels/time points will have a low score, because this is more likely to be a spurious result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement TFCE we again use the `mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test()` function, but we define the `threshold` kwarg using a dictionary with `start` and `step` parameters. This instructs the function to use TFCE. Because this stepwise process takes longer, we reduce the number of permutations by a factor of 10 to speed things up. To make reliable inferences, e.g., for a publication, we should stick with 50,000 permutations but for demonstration purposes we will use fewer here."

    "#### Interpreting TFCE Results\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to understand about the difference between the clustering approach above, and TFCE, is that TFCE applies this \"enhancement\" operation to the entire statistical image, whereas the clustering approach only applies it to clusters that have already been identified as significant. In other words, TFCE is a data-driven approach to identifying clusters, whereas the clustering approach is a hybrid of data-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches. An important consequence of this is how TFCE results are interpreted: whereas each cluster in the conventional clustering approach above can be interpreted as a single \"effect\", the TFCE approach does not identify clusters, but rather identifies the entire set of channels and time points that show a significant effect. Thus when we get a result, we can only say that the effect is present across the entire set of channels and time points, and we cannot say that it is present at any particular channel or time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences of this can be more or less impactful depending on your hypotheses and results. In the present data set we only predicted one significant effect, the N400. And indeed we only find one overall difference, which is the expected greater negativity for violation than control over channels near the vertex, roughly from 400–600 ms. Thus we can interpret the TFCE results as supporting a significant N400 effect. However, imagine if there were a second component, at a different time window and channels, that was also significant. For example, what if there was a larger *positivity* for Violation than Control over more anterior midline channels, from 800–1000 ms? (such a late positivity, or P600, is not uncommon in some N400 experiments). If our plot of TFCE results showed both the negative and positive differences — which we would attribute to two different components — we would not be able to interpret the results as supporting two components. Rather, we would only be able to say that there is a significant difference across the entire set of channels and time points. In this case, we would need to perform a follow-up analysis to determine which channels and time points are driving the effect. This could be done by performing a $t$ test at each channel and time point, and then using the clustering approach to identify significant clusters. Alternatively, if we predicted two distinct components *a priori*, then we could perform two separate TFCE analyses, each constrained to a particular time window when we expected that component, and then interpret the results as supporting two distinct components."
