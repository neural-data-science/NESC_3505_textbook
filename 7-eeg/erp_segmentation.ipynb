    "# Segmentation into ERP epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will learn how to segment continuous EEG data into epochs, time-locked to experimental events of interest. This is the stage at which we move from working with EEG data, to ERP data. Recall that *ERP* stands for *event-related potential* — short segments of EEG data that are time-locked to particular events such as stimulus onsets or participant responses. In the previous steps we removed artifacts from the continuous EEG data. Now, we will segment the data into epochs, and apply artifact correction to the segments, based on the ICA decomposition that we performed in the previous step, as well as using the AutoReject algorithm to automatically detect and remove bad epochs and channels that ICA may not fix."

    "### About Event Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Most EEG systems receive event codes from the stimulus computer using an electronic communications protocol called **TTL**, or transistor-to-transistor logic. It's very simple and low-level, and is done via the parallel port of a computer (which is so low-level, computers almost never have these built in anymore). The reason this arcane system is still routinely used in EEG is that its timing is very precise, which means it is the best option to get millisecond-level synchronization between when the stimulus computer presents a stimulus, and when the event code is received by the EEG system. This level of precision is vital in EEG research because the effects of interest occur on a millisecond time scale. The impact of this system for us is that the event codes stored in an EEG data file are usually restricted to integers in the range of 1–255, because that is the (8 bit) resolution of the TTL protocol (i.e., this kind of connection can inherently only send this range of values). Some EEG recording software allows the experimenter to specify text labels for each numerical event code, based on what the numbers mean in that particular experiment. However, in most cases mapping between the numerical event codes and meaningful labels is something we do in preprocessing, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern replacement for TTL signals is the [**Lab Streaming Layer**](https://labstreaminglayer.org/) (LSL), which is a software-based system for sending event codes and other data between computers. LSL involves one computer running an LSL server application, which other computers (or processes on the same computer) send data to via a network connection. LSL has a sophisticated way of synchronizing timing between multiple computers, which allows for good temporal precision. Besides not requiring computers that have parallel ports, LSL can aggregate data streams from a variety of sources, including stimulus presentation software, EEG and fNIRS systems, eye trackers, motion capture systems, and more. In the present data sets we use TTL codes, however MNE supports LSL and the processes demonstrated here are similar for LSL data.\n"

    "### The Event Dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "When MNE reads the event codes from a raw data file, it does a step that isn't always intuitive. Event codes in raw data files can take a variety of forms, depending on the software that was used to record the data. MNE searches through the raw data, and finds each unique event code (keeping in mind that event codes typically indicate a category of stimuli, or experimental condition, not the identity of individual stimuli or trials). MNE treats the event codes as strings, even if they are all numeric. MNE then assigns each unique event code an integer value. This mapping between original event codes and integers is stored in a dictionary called `events_dict`:"

    "In the above dictionary, the original event codes are the dictionary keys (on the left of the colons). You can see that the first two entries are not of experimental interest, but simply note the start of recording. The other event codes were originally numeric, but the recording software pre-pended `Stimulus/S` to the start of each one. MNE has simply matched each one to an integer, so the event codes used in MNE don't match the original event codes. This is why `events_dict` is critical to ensuring that you map the right event codes to the each event of experimental interest. Another step is required, though, because we need a way of mapping from the the codes that MNE is using in the data, to the labels for the events that make sense to us in terms of the experiment (e.g., different stimulus types, response onsets, etc.). \n",

    "### How MNE Interprets Event Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually a workaround for this. In the present case, we imported the filtered data that we created in a previous lesson. If instead we had applied `mne.events_from_annotations()` to the original `raw` data file, MNE would be able to parse the event codes, and will assign them the same integer values that they had in the original data file. This is because the original data file was in the BrainVision format, which stores the event codes in a way that MNE can read. However, if you apply `mne.events_from_annotations()` to the `raw_filt` data file, MNE will not be able to parse the event codes, because the data file is in the `.fif` format, which stores the event codes differently. In this case, MNE will assign new integer values to the event codes, starting at 1 for the first event code it finds in the file, as we see here. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, let's see the difference when we read the original raw file. Since we only want the event codes, and not the data,  we can speed the process up by setting the kwarg `preload=False`. This tells MNE to read the metadata from the file, but not the data itself. This also saves memory."

    "\n",
    "This data set was collected while the participant viewed a series of pictures of objects on a computer screen. One second after each picture was presented, a spoken word was played over a speaker. The word was either the name of the pictured object, or some other word. Based on prior research, we predicted an **N400** ERP component for the mismatch trials relative to those on which the picture and word matched. In other words, the experimental contrast we are interested in is between **Match** and **Mismatch** trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The N400 is a component first discovered by [Kutas & Hillyard (1980)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.7350657), in response to sentences that ended in a word whose meaning was not predicted given the preceding words in the sentence. For example, the sentence *I take my coffee with milk and dog.* would elicit an N400 at the word *dog*. More than 40 years of subsequent research has shown that the N400 is a marker of brain processes involved in integrating new information into an ongoing context that people maintain of words and concepts — or in technical terms, *semantic integration*. Violations of expectations related to the meaning of stimuli evoke an N400 response. In the present experiment, we did not use sentences, however each picture created a context and the subsequent word either fit (matched) or did not fit (mismatched) that context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there were really only two experimental conditions in this experiment (match and mismatch), as you  there are a lot more than two event codes in the `events` array and `events_dict` dictionary above! This is because in this study, the experimenters coded details of the stimuli in great detail. This is common in research, where we have one central research question, but perhaps other questions relating to more fine-grained details of the stimuli. As well, the stimuli may vary in ways that are not of experimental interest, but are properties that we would like to control for. For now we will label each event code.\n"

And, participants performed the task reasonably well, so the majority of responses were correct; we can see a few incorrect responses along the line marked `4` on the *y* axis. The other event codes occur less frequently, and at somewhat random intervals – these are the individual match and mismatch trials, whose order was randomized in the experiment.

    "\n",
    "Having extracted our event codes, and mapped them to labels, we are now ready to split the continuous, filtered raw EEG data into epochs time-locked to the event codes of interest, as defined in the `event_mapping` dictionary we created above. To do this we use `mne.Epochs()`, which creates an object of the class `Epochs`. The [API](https://mne.tools/stable/generated/mne.Epochs.html) for this function is: \n",
    "\n",
    "    mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=None, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.5, baseline=(None, 0), picks=None, preload=False, reject=None, flat=None, proj=True, decim=1, reject_tmin=None, reject_tmax=None, detrend=None, on_missing='raise', reject_by_annotation=True, metadata=None, event_repeated='error', verbose=None)\n",

    "- the first is the raw data. We will pass the filtered raw data.\n",
    "- the next two arguments are the events array, and the mapping of events to labels (we'll use `event_mapping`)\n",
    "- the fourth and fifth arguments are the start and end times of each epoch (`timn` and `tmax`), relative to the event code. Typically the minimum (start) time is a negative number, because for reasons explained below we want a *baseline* period to compare to the activity after the event code (typically 50-200 ms, but sometimes longer). The end time depends on the timing of the ERP components you expect to occur. Some types of stimuli and experiments (such as studies of attention, or face processing) may only be interested in ERPs that occur within, say, the first 500 ms after stimulus presentation. In language studies, interesting effects often occur up to 1 s or even longer after a word is presented. An important thing to note is that  times in MNE are always specified in *seconds* (which is a bit counter-intuitive because we commonly talk about the timing of ERPs in milliseconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "After these 5 required positional arguments, there are many kwargs we can specify. For our purposes, the defaults for most of these are fine. However, we will specify two additional kwargs: \n",
    "\n",
    "The `baseline` kwarg specifies what time period to use as the baseline for each epoch. The baseline is the period before the stimulus onset, and it is used to define \"zero\" voltage for each trial. This is necessary because the measured electrical potentials can drift quite a lot over the course of the experiment (even after we filter out the lowest-frequency drift), and artifacts can affect absolute microVolt values as well. So the absolute microVolt values for any given epoch might be rather different from other epochs, due to drift. By subtracting the mean amplitude over the baseline period from each trial (and for each channel), we \"center\" the measurements for that trial such that the potentials after the onset of each event code reflect the deviations of our measurements from the baseline period. Put another way, the measurements of each epoch reflect any changes in electrical potential that occur after the event code, relative to the baseline period before it. We use `(None, 0)` for the baseline to specify the time period from the start of the epoch to the time of the event code.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Subtracting the baseline like this is not always necessary, or desirable. Another approach is to leave the baseline untouched at the epoching stage, and worry about it later. In particular, there is an approach called <em>baseline regression</em> (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.13451\">Alday, 2019</a>) in which the mean amplitude of the baseline on each trial is used as a predictor in a regression model, which allows one to \"regress out\" the baseline on a trial-by-trial basis rather than subtracting it. This can be particularly useful in certain cases, such as when the baseline period isn't actually \"silent\" but contains some activity of interest (e.g., a previous word when reading a sentence or listening to a story; see e.g., <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.668276\">Sayehli et al., 2022</a>). However, the standard baseline subtraction approach is valid in most cases and we will use it here."

Typically what we want to see is the *average* across all trials of a condition. This is central to ERPs — the data on each individual trial is noisy, but when we average across many trials, the noise tends to cancel out, leaving the ERP component of interest.

Here, we can load that file and apply the ICA decomposition – and the exclusion of ICs – to the `epochs` data that we just created in the present lesson — i.e., the ERP data time-locked to events of interest. This works because what is stored in the `ica` object is not the original data that ICA was applied to, but a formula for applying a mathematical transformation to data.

    "ICA correction removed the ocular (blink and eye movement) artifacts. However, there are potentially other sources of noise remaining in the data, including muscle noise, \"paroxysmal\" artifacts (sudden, large-amplitude deflections), and other sources. Sometimes as well, individual channels contain noise either over the entire recording, or in specific segments. We can use the AutoReject algorithm to automatically detect and remove bad epochs and channels. Any channels that are removed are then replaced using interpolation – essentially averaging the data from surrounding channels to estimate the data from the noisy channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that we used AutoReject earlier, prior to running ICA. At that point, we used AutoReject to identify and exclude any particularly noisy segments of data from the ICA decomposition. But we didn't actually remove those segments from teh data set, we just told ICA to ignore them. Here, we will use AutoReject to identify *and* exclude any particularly noisy epochs, and correct noisy channels through interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we run the same code we used prior to ICA, except that we fit it to the `epochs_clean` data that has been cleaned with ICA. Another difference is that previously, we used the `.fit()` method to fit the AutoReject algorithm to the data, and then used the information stored in the fit to exclude noisy epochs from ICA. Here instead, we apply the `fit_transform()` method, which both fits the model, and *applies* the \"transformation\" (i.e., the exclusion of bad epochs and interpolation of bad channels) to the data. We include a kwarg asking the method to output a log of the steps that AutoReject took to clean the data. We can use this log to see what AutoReject did. We assign the output of this method to two variables, `epochs_clean` and `reject_log_clean`. The first is the cleaned data, and the second is the log."

This is useful bin visualizing the scalp distribution of effects in any particular condition, but it makes it impossible to compare between conditions. But to compare between two plots, we need to ensure that the colorbar ranges are the same for both. We can use the `vlim` kwarg to specify the range of values to use for the *y* axis and colorbar.
