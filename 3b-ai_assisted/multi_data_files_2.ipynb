    "```python\n",
    "# calculate the mean RT across all participantID\n",

The first option uses the `groupby` method to group the data by the `participantID` column, and then calculates the mean for each group. However, we don't want to calculate the mean for each group, we want to calculate the mean for all groups. Secondly, the command does not specify that we want the mean only for the reaction time column.\n",

    "At this point, we could use Copilot Chat again, but it might be more efficient to try writing the code ourselves, by adapting the second Copilot suggestion. The command is an example of **chaining**, in which several methods are applied in sequence to the same object. In this case, the object is the DataFrame `df`, and the methods are `.groupby()` and `.mean()`, which would be executed in sequence, from left to right. So what if we simply remove the `.groupby()` method? Let's try that; we'll copy and past the command (and its comment) into the code cell below, and then edit it. We need to be sure to keep the `[\"RT\"]` part though!"

    "This is a frightening example of a Copilot **hallucination**. The above code generates a table of numbers, one for each participantID.  You might think this is a plausible result. However, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, confidence intervals (CIs) are typically reported as a pair of values. The 95% CIs reflect the *range* within which it is 95% likely that the true mean lies, so we need an upper *and* lower limits of the CI. These are typically the same amount plus or minus the mean (e.g., if the mean is 2, the 95% CIs might be 1.5 and 2.5). So given a conceptual understanding of what CIs are, we recognize that we need to modify the code to generate the upper and lower values of the CIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if you look back at the mean RT for each participant, they were in the range of .339 – .449. Again, confidence intervals reflect the range of possible true values for the mean, given the sample data.  So for our confidence intervals to have values around 5 s seems implausible, given the mean RTs are < 500 ms. We would expect the CIs to be perhaps 100-200 ms. So it seems like Copilot is calculating the CIs incorrectly.\n",

    "This code illustrates a feature of Python that we haven't seen before: using a comma to separate two commands. This is a way of executing two commands in a single line of code. It's not a very common way of writing code, but as you can see in this example, it can be useful: the output is a Python `tuple`, which is an immutable, ordered collection of values. This is a good type to use when you have a pair of values that belong together, and the immutable nature of tuples means that you can't accidentally change one of the values. Furthermore, the ordering means you can access the values by their position in the tuple, which is useful in this case because, using this prompt, Copilot will always put the upper CI first and the lower CI second.\n",
