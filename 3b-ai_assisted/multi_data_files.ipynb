    "# Working With Multiple Data Files Using Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will revisit some of the material covered at the end of the introductory chapter on Python. Specifically, reading multiple data files, manipulating the data using pandas, and deriving some basic information from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions are very high-level, because we want you to work on writing Copilot prompts yourself, based on high-level instructions rather than us giving you step-by step guidance. The version of this lesson in the online textbook, however, shows the worked example with prompts and Copilot-generated code."

    "\n",
    "Your task is to perform the operations below, using Python code generated by a combination of your own writing, and GitHub Copilot's suggestions. For your own learning, you are best off to start each step by trying to write the code yourself. If it works, great – you've learned something in Python! Congratulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it doesn't work, then you can try again, or use Copilot to help you out. Copilot is meant to speed up your coding, so in practice it's preferable to use it to help you out when you get stuck, than spend too much time trying to figure out how to do something yourself. On the other hand, once you have the solution from Copilot, it's important to try to understand what it is doing. You may have to look up some of the functions it's using, if you're not familiar with them. The tasks below intentionally ask you to do things that we haven't taught in this course yet. That's because we want you to learn how to use Copilot to help you out when you don't know how to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're ignorant of what the code you generated is doing, you risk errors, or simply not being able to explain correctly what you did. Also, look for ways to check that the results you get are correct (using code). \n",

    "### The Data and What to Do With It\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three data files in the `data` directory: `s1.csv`, `s2.csv`, and `s3.csv`. Each file contains the reaction times (RTs) from 10 trials of a relatively simple task in which participants had to indicate which direction a briefly-presented arrow was pointing. The RTs are in seconds (s). Each file contains the RTs from a different participant. In each file there are three columns. You can determine what the columns are by looking at the first row (header) of each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate code that reads in the three files and combines them in a pandas DataFrame. Include error-checking  code that determines you loaded in the correct number of trials (30) and the correct number of columns (3). If the number of trials or columns is incorrect, print an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the dataframe to a file called `all_data.csv`, in the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the DataFrame, calculate:\n",
    "- the mean RT for each participant\n",
    "- the mean RT across all participants\n",
    "- the 95% confidence intervals for the mean RT for each participant\n",
    "- the 95% confidence intervals for the mean RT across all participants\n",
    "\n",
    "Print all of the above results to the screen, with accompanying text that indicates what each result is.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well, generate a plot of the mean RT for each participant, with error bars showing the 95% confidence intervals."

    "Typically, when you get a long, scary error message like the one above, you can ignore a lof of what is in the middle. The most important parts are the last line, which tells you what the error is, and the first lines, which usually indicate what line in the code you tried to run caused the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we see a `KeyError: 'subject'` at the bottom of the error message. Recall that Python dictionaries are sets of key-value pairs. The keys are the names of the columns, and the values are the data in those columns. You can think of a pandas DataFrame as a dictionary in which the column names are keys, and the values in that column are its values. So the error message above indicates that the code tried to access a column called `subject` in the DataFrame, but that column doesn't exist. We can see at the top of the error message that the code that caused the error is: `---> 26 df.groupby('subject').mean()`. This means it's line 26 of the cell above that caused the error. \n",

You can turn them on by right-clicking the area to the left of the code cell (under the triangle that executes the cell), and selecting `Show Cell Line Numbers`. Alternatively, if the code cell is in command (not edit) mode, you can press the `l` key to toggle line numbers on and off.\n",

    "When you're debugging a code cell that contains a lot of different commands, like the one above, it can be a bit challenging to narrow down where the error is. One way to do this is to click inside the cell, and look for the small toolbar that appears in the top right corner of the cell. If you mouse over the first (left) button in that toolbar, it will say `Run by line`. Click this and the cell will execute up to and including the first command (after any `import` statements). So in the cell above, this would execute up to and including the line `file_list = glob.glob('data/s*.csv')`. The next line of code will be highlighted, with a pointer beside it. This tells you what is next to run. Clicking the same button again will run the highlighted line, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this up until right before the line you know generated an error. Then, without running the \"bad\" line, create a new cell below the cell you're debugging, and you can run other code to inspect the variables that you have in memory. For example, you can ask for a list of the names of columns, and the first few lines of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option, rather than running the cell line-by-line, is to select all of the code from the line that's generating the error to the bottom of the cell, cut it, and paste it into a new cell below. Then you can run the code up to the line that's generating the error, and inspect the variables in memory. Sometimes this is easier, especially if you have a lot of code in the cell.\n",

Warnings are worth looking at as well, because they can indicate that something is not quite right.
