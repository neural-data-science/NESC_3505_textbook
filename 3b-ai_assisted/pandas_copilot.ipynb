    "In the previous section we tried some very basic things with Copilot. Now let's try a more complex example. In the previous chapter, we worked with the Gapminder dataset, which is a CSV file. We used the `pandas` library to read the CSV file into a `DataFrame`, and then used the `DataFrame` to do some analysis. Let's do that again, but this time we'll use Copilot to help us.\n",

    "That generated a scary looking error message! This is human error, not AI error. But before we sort that out, let's marvel at what Copilot did there. We gave it a pretty poor prompt (\"the gapminder data for europe\"), and it guessed that the file was named `gapminder_gdp_europe.csv`. It also guessed that we wanted to use the `pandas` library (`pd`) to read the CSV file into a `DataFrame`. That's pretty impressive!\n",

    "Can you figure out why this error happened? Ideally, you should be able to do this by re-reading the code the Copilot generated. But, the error message also provides guidance, because it tells us there is an error on line 7 (this information is near the top of the error message), and the error is `KeyError: 'group'`. That means that `gapminder_europe` doesn't have a column named `group`. Indeed, if we look at line 7 we see it's attempting to group the data by two columns, `year` and `group`. But `gapminder_europe` doesn't have a column named `group`, which is why we got an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually a few problems with this code. Not only does `group` not exist as a column, but it's not a great name for a column, because the column should indicate region of Europe. So a better name would be `region`. Another issue is that the `.groupby()` method was given another variable, `year`. But our instructions didn't say anything about year, so we don't want to group by year. We just want to group by region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try fix those issues through better **prompt engineering**. One thing you'll encounter frequently is that you give Copilot too big a job, and doing what you're asking will require a number of intermediate steps. Copilot isn't great about long-term planning. Remember that LLMs are just advanced versions of the same kind of language model that suggests words when you're typing on your phone. It's often good at predicting the next word you want to type, but if you keep just picking the \"best\" suggestion, you will get a sentence of gibberish more times than not. The same is true with Copilot. If you give it a big job, it will often generate code that doesn't work, because it's trying to do too much at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to break the job down into smaller steps. In this case, we're doing split-apply-combine, so let's try writing our own prompts for each of those conceptual steps. So let's start with the first step, 'split', and see if we can get Copilot to generate the code to group the data by region."

We could do that here to help Copilot along, but hopefully AI is smart enough to know what geographical region each European country is in.

    "Although our prompt may be readily interpretable by a human brain, in terms of communicating what we want, apparently it's too complex for Copilot's AI. If we think about the task we're asking Copilot to do, there are several sub-tasks. That is, in one prompt we're asking Copilot to create four different lists. What if, instead, we ask for one list at a time? \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if we start with the prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of the countries in Northern Europe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Copilot will generate the code to create a list of the countries in Northern Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "northern_europe = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a good start. But we need to do this for each region. So if we hit `Enter` a couple of times to get a blank line, and then type the prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of the countries in \n",
    "```\n",
    "Copilot is smart enough to complete this prompt with `Southern Europe`, and generate the code to create a list of the countries in Southern Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, if we accept that code and hit `Enter` two more times, Copilot will actually generate the complete next prompt for us:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of the countries in Eastern Europe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we accept that one, it generates the code for us, *and* generates the next prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of the countries in Western Europe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we accept that last prompt, and the code it generates, and again hit `Enter` twice, Copilot really shines. It generates the same prompts we saw above, and the code to create a new column called `region`, and then starts by labelling all countries as `Western Europe`. It generated this code earlier, but it didn't work because we hadn't first used the right prompts to get the four lists of countries in each region. Copilot then goes on to generate code to change the region labels for each country, based on the lists we created above. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we try to run this code, we get an error:"

When I started typing `s` rather than accepting `gapminder_europe`, Copilot suggested `south_europe` – but if you look at the code above, Copilot had named that list `southern_europe`. So, even though Copilot *can* be sensitive to the context of the file you're working in, it's still not perfect, and may suggest erroneous code such as the wrong variable name. If you're not paying attention, and understanding the code you're generating with Copilot, it's highly likely that you will make a lot of errors. But after manually editing the Copilot-generated code (changing `south_europe` to `southern_europe`), Copilot did produce a correct suggestion for how to remove `Malta` from the `southern_europe` list:"

    "Why is this happening? Well, we assumed that when Copilot generated those lists of countries in each region, it would use the countries in the `gapminder_europe` DataFrame. But in reality, we don't know how it generated those lists. Maybe it was based on data used to train Copilot that had a larger list of countries in Europe, rather than just the countries in the DataFrame. And again, Copilot was not accurately sensitive to the context of our notebook file. \n",

We can keep repeating this process until we get no errors, but that seems tedious, and could take a long time (especially if we were working with a larger data set). Let's see if we can tweak our prompts from above to generate more accurate lists of countries in each region.\n"

Again, we need to break the problem down into smaller steps. Let's start with the first step, and see if we can get Copilot to generate the code to create a list of the countries in Northern Europe,as it did before. Then, in a second step, let's ask it to remove the countries not in the DataFrame. I tried this:\n",

For completeness – having all the code for one conceptual step in one cell – we'll copy and paste the Northern Europe code from above, then generate additional prompts for the other regions.

    "If you look at the code that Copilot generated above, and compare it to what we used in the <a href=../3-python/pandas_dataframes.ipynb>pandas lesson</a> previous chapter, you'll see that it's quite similar in that both use the <code>gapminder_europe.loc</code> method to label countries according to region. However, the process of generating it required some trial and error, and some manual intervention. This isn't actually different from what you would probably be doing – especially as a novice coder – if you were writing the code yourself. But, perhaps ironically, part of the code that we had to prompt Copilot to generate, was to fix errors in the code that it generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, if you look back at the pandas lesson, the lists of countries in each region were defined manually — and in fact there was no explanation as to how those lists were created. Those lists were created manually by someone reviewing the list of country names in the DataFrame, and using their knowledge of geography (or maybe an internet search) to assign the countries to the labels. In contrast, Copilot generated those lists for us (based on the vast corpus of data it was trained on), which saved us a lot of time. The fact that we had to write additional code to clean up the lists is a small price to pay for that time savings. And indeed, cleaning data is a routine part of data science, and it's good to be able to do it in code, rather than manually. \n",

    "## Critically Evaluating Copilot's Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our previous pandas lesson and Copilot both used the `gapminder_europe.loc` method to label countries, there is one important difference between what we showed in the previous lesson, and Copilot's code. Copilot first labelled all countries as `Western Europe`, and then changed the label for non-Western countries. In contrast, in the previous lesson we used the same `gapminder_europe.loc` method to label Western countries as Copilot did here for the other regions. This illustrates how different code can be used to accomplish the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just because two approaches do the same job (or appear to), there is some danger to the approach that Copilot took here. In labelling all the countries first as `Western Europe`, the assumption is that the other labels we use will cover all of the countries that are not `Western Europe`. However, what if there was a country that was in the DataFrame, but not in any of Copilot's lists of regions? Those countries would be labeled as `Western Europe`, which might be incorrect. In that case, the code Copilot generated would create bugs that would affect the outcome of any analyses applied to the data. This is a good example of why it's important to **read and understand the code you're using**, and not just blindly accept what Copilot generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, a good data scientist will assume the worst of their, or AI-generated, code, and test it to make sure it's doing what it's supposed to do. In this case, since the concern is that a country not in Western Europe may get that label, we can check by comparing the countries with that label in the DataFrame, with the list `western_europe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Copilot to Check its Own Work\n",
    "Fortunately, Copilot can help us check it's own work – it even correctly generated a lot of the detailed prompt you see below! The prompt below also shows that you can use complex, multi-step prompts with Copilot, and it will generate code for each step. The difference between the complex prompt here, and some that failed above, is that we clearly end each step with a period, and start the next step as a new sentence."

At the same time, as a learner and a critical user of AI-generated code, you should take the time to understand what the code is doing, and why. In this case, you can do internet searches for the components of that code that you may not recognize, such as the `set()` function and the `.index` method (``)."

    "\n",
    "- GitHub Copilot is a great coding **partner**. On its own, it often generates errors — including both fatal Python errors, and more sneaky errors that may not be obvious — cases where the code runs without errors, but there are flaws in the logic of the code. \n",
    "- In spite of the risk of errors errors, Copilot can save you time by quickly generating code, and often generating things that would take you significant time to look up. \n",
    "- The best approach to using Copilot is to break down your coding tasks into small steps, and prompt Copilot to generate code for each step. Always be conscious of what you're trying to do and be clear in the expected outputs of that code. \n",
    "- Always actually *read* the code that Copilot generates and be sure you understand it. Based on that understanding, confirm the logic of what it's doing, and ensure it's what you expect.\n",
    "- Always *test* the results of the code Copilot generates, to confirm that it's doing what you expect.\n",
    "- This approach will help you both code more efficiently, and become a better coder yourself. Professional coders have eagerly adopted Copilot due to the efficiencies it creates — but there is a learning curve, and ultimately it is just another tool in your toolbox, not the *only* tool you need.
