    "\n",
    "We've now completed the task of calculating the mean RT and 95% CIs for each participant, and for all participants. We've also learned a lot about how to use Copilot to help us write code, and how to use Copilot Chat to help us understand errors and fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the process of using AI to generate code isn't always smooth, nor are the results always accurate. It's critical to critically assess the outputs you see, and to understand what you are asking Copilot to do — as well as what the code it generates is doing. In this lesson, for the sake of expediency and length we did not provide detailed explanations of what the code was doing every step of the way. However, you've seen that Copilot can be useful at explaining code for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were also many points in this lesson where, as an experienced coder, I knew what the problem was and how to fix it. However, I deliberately did not fix the problems myself, because I recognize that as a novice coder you may not know how to fix the problems. Hopefully this lesson has shown you how to use Copilot effectively, but also underscored the value of actually knowing Python and being able to read and debug code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach to learning to use Python for data science is to write code yourself when you can,  because this helps build and reinforce your knowledge (remember, coding is a procedural skill that you only learn by doing — and you lose the knowledge if you don't use it). But, when you encounter a problem you've never solved before, or are getting errors in your Code, Copilot can be a huge help to deepen your knowledge and solve problems. As we've seen, Copilot Chat can be much more useful in this regard than simply writing prompts in code cells of your notebook, because it gives you both code, and detailed explanations of what that code is doing.

We believe — and feel this lesson has demonstrated — that learning to write code yourself is the best way to learn to code. However, whether you're taking this course for credit and have assignments that Copilot may be useful in helping with, or simply using this book to learn how to apply Python to your own data, we recognize that Copilot can be a useful tool. We hope this chapter has given you a good introduction to how to use Copilot effectively, and that you will continue to use it on your coding journey.\n",
