    "- dictionaries are a special type of collection called *mappings*\n",
    "- each dictionary entry is specified as a key:value pair\n",
    "- key:value pairs are assigned to variable names within curly braces: `{}`\n",
    "- keys must be immutable types, such as strings or numbers. \n",
    "    - however, dictionary values can be any Python type, including lists or other dictionaries\n",
    "- dictionaries are mutable, in that one can add or delete entries, or change the value of an entry\n",
    "    - however, dictionary keys cannot be renamed. Instead, you must delete the old key:value pair and create a new one\n",
    "- dictionaries are unordered, so you cannot access an entry based on its serial (sequential) position the way you can entries in a list\n",
    "    - instead, you access values based on their keys\n",
    "- the length of a dictionary is the number of key:value pairs it contains\n",
    "- you can see a list of all dictionary keys or values using the `.keys()` and `.values()` methods, respectively"
