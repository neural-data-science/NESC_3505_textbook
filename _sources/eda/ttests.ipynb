    "## The *t* test\n",
    "\n",
    "A *t* test is used to compare the means of two sets of data. For example, in the flanker experiment we used in the [previous section](./repeated_meaasures), we could compare the mean RTs for the congruent and incongruent conditions. *t* tests consider the size of the difference between the means of the two data sets, relative to the variance in each one. The less the distributions of values in the two data sets overlap, the larger the *t* value will tend to be. We can then estimate the probability that the observed difference occurred simply by chance, rather than due to a true difference — this is the *p* value. Typically, researchers use a *p* < .05 threshold to determine statistical significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*t* tests are implemented in the [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org) library, which \"provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines, such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra, and statistics.\" Each of those type of routines is in a separate sub-module of SciPy; the one we'll want is `scipy.stats`. We can import this specific module with the command:"

    "\n",
    "Let's start by comparing the mean RTs for the congruent and incongruent flanker conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we are working with repeated-measures data – for each participant, we have 160 trials across 4 conditions. *t* tests are not meant for *within-condition* repeated measures data — we need only one measurement per participant in each condition. This is for essentially the same reason discussed at the end of the previous section on repeated measures data: if we treat the within-participant variability the same as the between-participant variability, then we will tend to grossly under-estimate the true (between-participant) variance. When running a *t* test, this would result in erroneously large *t* values that could often falsely suggest a statistically significant result. So, we need to use the aggregated data, `df_avg`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important characteristic of our data are that, even though aggregation has reduced the data to one measurement per participant, we still have repeated measures, across the two conditions. The default assumption of a *t* test is that each of the two data sets being compared come from different samples of the population (often called a *between-subjects design* in Psychology). This means that *t* tests assume there is no relationship between any particular measurement in each of the two data sets being compared. When we have measurements from the same people in both data sets (a *within-subjects. design*), we need to account for this, or the *t* test will again suggest an inflated (incorrect) value. We account for this by using a **paired *t* test**. In SciPy, this is the function [`ttest_rel()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html).  (For a between-subjects — or *independent groups* design, which we will not cover here, you would use [`ttest_ind()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Select the data\n",
    "Running `ttest_rel()` is as simple as giving it the two sets of data you want to compare, as arguments. We can pull these directly from our `df_avg` pandas DataFrame. We'll do this in a few lines of code below, first assigning each data set to a new variable, and then running the *t* test."

    "    \n",
    "By default, SciPy's `ttest_` functions return **2-tailed *p* values**. This means that the *p* value considers both possible directions of difference between the two conditions. In the present example, that means *either* RTs for congruent are faster than incongruent, *or* they are slower for congruent than incongruent. In contrast, a **1-tailed *p* value** should be used if we have a specific prediction of a \"direction\" of the difference. Using a 1-tailed *p* value will tend to be less conservative, i.e., more likely to find a significant effect. This is because, for a given *p* threshold (e.g., $\\alpha = .05$), a 2-tailed test effectively splits the *p* in half, and reflects a probability of 2.5% that the result occurred by chance in one direction (e.g., congruent slower) and a 2.5% probability of getting the revser result (e.g., congruent faster) by chance. In contrast, a 1-tailed test allocates all of the 5% chance probability to the likelihood of a difference in one direction (e.g., congruent faster).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Practically speaking, 2-tailed tests should be used by default, but if you have a specific a priori hypothesis regarding the direction of the difference, you can use a 1-tailed test. For example, for the flanker experiment we're working with here, previous research would lead us to the congruent-faster hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present example, it really doesn't matter since the two-tailed *p* value is wildly significant. However, if you want to convert to one-tailed *p* values, you just need to divide *p* in half:"
