    "[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a great Python plotting package that is built on top of Matplotlib. That is, it uses Matplotlib \"under the hood\", but it offers the user a much simpler API (set of commands) that enable us to generate a variety of great-looking plots that are particularly useful in data science. You can check out Seaboarn's [examples gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) to see some of the cool stuff you can do (including plotting neuroscience data!). Seaborn was written by [Michael Waskom](https://mwaskom.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing Seaborn to Matplotlib, you could say that Matplotlib givens you every sharp, hard-to-use tool in the shed, and you have to figure out how to learn them all without chopping off a finger. Fortunatley in data science you aren't likely to lose any fingers, but Seaborn gives you some DIY-friendly power tools to get data science jobs done easily and looking great. \n",

    "You can see that Seaborn's functions are organized around the different types of data, and questions we typically ask of data in data science. The `relpolt` function plots relationships between different (continuous) variables; the `displot` function plots distributions of data (such as histograms), and the`catplot` function.\n"
