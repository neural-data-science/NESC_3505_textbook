# Introduction
## Single Unit Data and Spike Trains

This chapter introduces data obtained from recordings of individual neurons, which we typically call **single unit** data ("units" being neurons). Single unit data is typically analyzed in terms of **spike trains** — sequences of action potentials: how they can be represented as data, and some ways of working with and visualizing them. As well, the chapter introduces a few new bits of Python syntax and a discussion of the use of colour in scientific visualization.
