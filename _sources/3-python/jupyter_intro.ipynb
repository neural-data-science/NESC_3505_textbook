    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "You are currently viewing a Jupyter notebook file. Jupyter notebooks are composed of *cells*. Cells can be of three types: code, Markdown, or raw. This cell you're reading is Markdown, a simple language for formatting rich text. The cell below is a code cell, where you can write and run Python commands. Raw cells are \"raw\" text — they aren't fancy-formatted Markdown, and they aren't run-able as code. They also aren't terribly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells have two modes: **Edit** and **Command**.  In Edit mode, you will see a flashing cursor, and you can type into the cell and edit it. In Command mode, manipulate it in certain ways (e.g., deleting a whole cell, or moving it). Only one cell is ever in Edit mode at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text you are currently reading is a Markdown cell. Assuming you are viewing it in VS Code, and click once on this text, the cell should become active in command mode, so you should see a some color cue that it is now selected (the specifics depend on the color theme you are using). If you double-click on this (or any other Markdown) cell, the text will change to a *fixed-width* font and you'll see the Markdown formatting tags (like `#` for headings), and a flashing cursor will appear where you clicked. Try it! To return to command mode, press the Shift & Enter keys on your keyboard simultaneously, or hit the Escape key. You can also just click on another cell, however in that case this cell will remain in Edit mode --- i.e., with a fixed width font and the Markdown tags visible --- until you press Shift & Enter or Escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary:\n",
    "- Single-clicking a cell will select it in Command mode\n",
    "- Double-clicking a cell will put it in Edit mode\n",
    "- Pressing the Shift & Enter keys on your keyboard simultaneously will execute a cell. Execution will format a Markdown cell, or run the code in a code cell. \n",

Otherwise, click on `Python environments` and select the Python environment you want to use. It may simply be called `Python` followed by a version number (like 3.12.1), or it may have a name like `neural_data_science`, if you installed Python on your own computer.\n",

Each notebook you open will start a new Python kernel (sometimes, as with this one, you'll need to select the kernel the first time you open the file). As long as the kernel is running, the things you do in Python will be stored in memory (RAM). This will make more sense as you start to use Python, but when you're running Python, you generally don't just run commands and get output. You also read data files into memory, and store the results of one command in memory for use in the next command. For example, a bit earlier in this notebook you were instructed to run a cell with the code `x = 1`, so now your kernel has a variable `x` in memory, with the value `1`. CLearing cell outputs doesn't affect what the kernel has in memory. If you want to clear the memory, you need to restart the kernel.\n",
