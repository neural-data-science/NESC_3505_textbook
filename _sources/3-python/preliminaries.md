# Preliminaries

In this section, we'll explore the Jupyter notebook environment in VS Code, and learn how to use it to write and run Python code. We'll also talk about some resources to get additional help as you're learning Python.

If you're taking this course at Dalhousie University, you will obtain a copy of the repository containing all the workbooks and data files you need to complete the course via GitHub Classroom. 

If you're not taking the course at Dalhousie, and using Codespaces, then you probably already have a copy (clone) of this chapter's materials in your GitHub account, because you've been following along with the instructions in the previous chapters. If you don't have a copy of the repository, you can get it by following the instructions in the [Codespaces](../2b-setup/codespaces) page.
