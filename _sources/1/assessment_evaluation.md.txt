# Assessment and Evaluation

This is a university course, and so you will receive a grade at the end of it. This grade is meant to reflect the quality of your work and how well you met the learning objectives of the course.

Although they may seem like similar concepts, there is an important difference between "assessment" and "evaluation" {cite}`conrad_assessment_2018`. Formally, **assessment** refers to ongoing feedback from the teaching team, your peers, and your own self-assessment of your performance. The goal of assessment is to help you learn, and improve your performance. For this reason it is often called **formative** — as in, helping to "form" and shape a better you.

Conversely, **evaluation** is **summative** — it is intended to "sum up" your performance in the course, and is used to determine your course grade. Whereas assessment is intended to be an ongoing process, evaluation is a judgement applied when you have completed a set of work designed to evaluate your learning (such as an assignment or project). Evaluations represent a judgement by the teaching team of how well you met the objectives of the assignment or project.

This course includes a number of formative assessments and summative evaluations. Formative assessments include DataCamp lessons, quizzes, self-assessments, and peer assessments. Summative evaluations include assignments and projects. Notably, both contribute to your final grade, but the majority of your grade is based on evaluations, whereas a smaller proportion of your grade is based on assessments. This is because assessments are intended to support and prepare you for evaluations — assessments are "training camp", and evaluations are the "big games".

## Everyone starts with an F

One of the game-like elements this course employs is a cumulative approach to grading, based on the notion of **experience points** (**XP**). You likely have played games, like RPGs (role-playing games), in which your character starts at level 1, and over time levels up by completing tasks (like quests or battles), which reward you with XP. The more challenges you complete, the more XP you gain, and the higher your character's level becomes, usually up to some top level.

In this course, you start with 0 XP, which equates to a grade of "F". Your challenge is to gain enough XP to achieve the grade you desire. XP are gained by completing lessons, assignments, and projects, as well as by contributing to activities such as peer teaching and improvements to course materials. In some cases, simply completing a task is sufficient to gain the full XP (the equivalent of a pass/fail evaluation; this is largely for formative assessments), but in other cases XP are awarded in proportion to the quality of the work (the work is graded; summative evaluation). Details about grading and XP are specified in the {doc}`syllabus <syllabus>`.

While on the one hand this might sound a bit gimmicky, it's actually a really powerful re-framing of the concepts of assessment and evaluation in a course. This framing also makes assessment more authentic, in the sense that you are receiving credit for achieving specific, meaningful learning outcomes. It also recognizes that throughout the course, you are continuously building knowledge, experience, and skills. As well, there are more opportunities to earn XP than you need to get an A+ in the course, meaning that you can, within reason, pick and choose how to achieve your desired grade. You can also earn bonus points to make up for earning fewer points in other areas. All that said, XP (and your grade) are intended to reflect the degree to which you have met the learning objectives, so you do need to demonstrate competence with regard to all of the objectives.

## Deadlines

As with any course, there are deadlines for submitting work. Deadlines exist for a few reasons. For one, they are designed to keep you on track; the work in this course is cumulative, and largely entails learning how to do things (rather than memorizing knowledge for later regurgitation) — so if you fall behind, it will be increasingly hard to catch up. As well, formative assessments are only useful in supporting continuous development if they are short, frequent, and timely. If they don't happen on time, they just don't happen because if they're late they're usually not useful, and/or another formative piece is already due.

Due dates are also part of this courses' emulation of professional working environments: in the real world, projects have deadlines and meeting this is usually critical to the ongoing success and reputation of the organization. Deadlines also respect the time of the teaching team who have to evaluate your work. Doing this is much easier in "batch" mode, meaning that late work is disproportionately time-consuming (and frankly, annoying) to grade.

At the same time, it is recognized that over the 7-13 weeks of a course, life happens, sometimes in ways that interfere with completing work. For this reason, evaluation components have some flexibility built into them, for example allowing you to choose which assignment scores you want to contribute to your final grade (within limits; see syllabus). As well, assignments with due dates have a late policy of deducting 1% from the final grade per hour that the assignment is late; this is meant to encourage timeliness, but impose relatively little penalty for "almost on time" work or last-minute hiccups.
