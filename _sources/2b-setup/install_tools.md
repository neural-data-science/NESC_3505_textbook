# Install on Your Computer

This section will walk you through the steps you need to take to install the tools you need for this course on your own computer. This includes the Anaconda Python distribution, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop, and Git. This step is *optional*; it is more work, and if you're new to Python, and coding in general, it is recommended that you start with the [GitHub Codespaces](./codespaces) option. However, if you're comfortable with installing software on your computer, and you want to have the flexibility to work offline, then this is the way to go.

Be sure to check out the accompanying [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/tF6_xp3LU8A), which will walk you through the steps in real time with the advantage of seeing each step performed.
